# CI Builder Maven
(ci-builder-maven)

This Dockerfile creates a Docker image based on Maven version 3.9.6, and includes both SSH and GnuPG (gnupg2). This image is specifically designed to serve as a builder in Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines, providing essential tools for Java project compilation, artifact management, and secure communication:

- **Maven**: Facilitates the automation and management of the Java project build process.
- **SSH**: Ensures secure communication for CI tasks such as accessing private repositories or remote servers, critical for operations that require authenticated connections.
- **GnuPG (gnupg2)**: Enables the signing of artifacts, which is vital for verifying the integrity and ensuring the security of distributed builds in various environments.

The inclusion of these tools supports a comprehensive range of CI activities, making it a versatile choice for projects that require high standards of security and reliability in their build and deployment processes.
